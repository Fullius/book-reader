            On a cold Sunday evenning in early 1957 - the very day, in fact, 
            that Dwight David Eisenhower took the oath of office for the
            second time as President of the United States of America - 
            Sarah Dewhurst waited with her father in the parking lot of 
            the Chevron gas station for the dragon he'd hired to help on 
            the farm.
                "He's late," Sarah said, quietly.
                "It," said her father, spitting on the oiled dirt, hitting the 
            cracks of a frozen puddle. "Don't call it by its name. Don't tell 
            it yours. It. Not he."
                This didn't address the question of the dragon's latness.
            Or maybe it did, in her father's sternness, in the spitting.
                "It's freezing out here," she said.
                "It's winter."
                "Can I wait in the truck?"
                "You're the one who was so eager to come with me."

                Then why are you hiring one? Sarah thought, though knew
            better than to say. She even knew the answer: they couldn't 
            afford to pay men to clear the two south fields. Those fields
            had to be planted, and if they were, then there was a chance - 
            a small one, but a chance - that they wouldn't lose the farm to
            the bank. If a dragon spent a month or so burning the trees,
            carrying out the ash and remnants, then maybe by the end
            of February, Gareth Dewhurst could be turning the charcoal
            over with a pair of cheaply hired horses and the plough that
            was thirty years out of date. Then perhaps by April, the new
            fields would be ready for planting. And perhaps that would be
            enough to hold off the creditors until harvest.
                Such has been the overwhelming, exhausting though of
            both Sarah and her father in the two years since the death
            of her mother, as the farm slid slowly beyond the ability of two
            people to run and further and further into dept. The worry
            was so strong it had shoved their grief to one side so they could
            work every hour her father was awake and every hour Sarah 
            was not at school.
                Sarah heard her father breath out, long, through his nose.
            It was always his preamble to softening.
                "You can drive home," he said, quietyly, back over his 
            shoulder.
                "What about Deputy Kelby?" she asked, her stomach
            tensing as it always did at thought of Deputy Kelby.
                "Do you really think I'd be meeting a hired claw if I didn't
            know Kelby was off-duty tonight? You can drive."
                She was five feet behind him but still hid her smile.

            do then?
                Sarah pulled her coat tighter around her, tying the belt.
            It was her mother's coat and she was already outgrowing it,
            but not by enough to find the money for a new one. It strained

            sloppy with stars, including a spill of the Milky Way across
            the middle. This part of the country was famous for its rain,
            though more accurately for its endless grey days. This night,
            though, Janurary 20, 1957, was clear. The three-quarter moon
            was low in the sky, bright but a supporting player to the specks
            of white.
                Specks of white that now had a shadow cast across them.

            peace between the two for hundreds of years. Her father's
            prejudice wasn't uncommon among people his age, though

            late, mysterious creatures so comprehensively ignored men

            labour. In Sarah's generation, though, it was hard to find a
            teenager who didn't also want to be one.
                This particular dragon was flying in from the north, which
            Sarah liked to think meant it had come from the great dragon
            Wastes of western Canada, one of the few natural landscapes
            left in the world where dragons still flew wild, still held their
            own socities, still kept their own secrets. She knew this was
            fanciful. Canada was nearly two hundred miles away, the
            Wastes a farther two hundred beyond that. Besides which,
            the Canadian dragons had withdrawn official communica-
            tion with men a decade before Sarah's father was born. Who
            knew what they got up to in the Wastes these past fifty years?
            The individuals who still hired themselves out as labour gave
            no answers, if they even knew. This one was probably only 
            coming from another farm, another place of grubby, poorly 
            paid hire.
                It flew over them.
                He, thought Sarah. He flew over them. The only reason
            she didn't think she was because her father had slipped when
            he first mentioned the hiring. "It's not illegal," he'd dais, which
            Sarah knew, "but there'll be trouble no matter what. We keep
            quiet until he's already working and no one can stop him."

                Beyond the light of the gas station, the dragon remained a
            silhouette as it circled, but even so, Sarah was surprised by its
            size. Fifty feet from wing to wing tip, possibly sixty.
                The dragon was small.

            rightfully said about potential trouble. Even so, this dragon
            was clearly more cautious than most of its kind.
                When it finally landed, she saw why. She also saw why it 
            was so small.
                "He's blue," she said, breaking several of the rules her
            father had set down.
                "I won't tell you to hush again," he said, not turning
            around, for his eyes were only on the dragon now.
                The dragon was blue. Or a blue, Sarah corrected herself,
            and of course, not actual blue but the blue of horses and cats,
            a dark silvery grey that tinged into blue in the right light. What
            he was not was the burnt blackish red of the Canadian drag-

            mountains in the distance, making their trips to who knew

                But a blue. A blue was Russian, at least originally, in heri-

            its wings hooking into the ground at each step, those great
            wings flaring on either side, making itself look bigger, more

            noses were sharper than a bloodhound's. It was rumoured they
            could smell more than just odour, that they could smell your

                It was her father's turn to be confused. "What?"

            melting down his cheaply made wedding ring. It was all they

                "It had to assess the work," her father said, heading back
            to the truck.
                "Where was I?" she said, following him. "You said you
            got it through Mr INagawa's broker-"
                "You don't need to know everything." He got behind the

                A moment later, they were on the road. Sarah shifted
            through the gears easily, even with the truck's notoriously
            sticky clutch, even through the hills and turns that marked
            this part of the county. She avoided potholes, she signalled

            complained anyway.
                "Not so fast," he said, as they trundled off the last stretch
            of paved street in Frome, Washington, the little hamlet their
            farm was in distant orbit of. "You never know when a deer
            could jump out at you."
                "There's a dragon in the sky," she said, looking up at the
            stars through the windshield. "The deer will be hiding."
                "If they know what's good for them," her father said, but
            at least he stopped talking about her driving. The road was
            black save for her headlights. No street lights, no lights from
            nearby houses as there weren't any, just heavy forest closing in
            like the night itself. They drove in silence for a few moments,
            Sarah thinking about having to rise in six short hours to tend
            to the chickens and hogs before heading to school.
                Then she remembered. "What was that about a witness?
            What was I a witness to?"
                "Dragons think men lie," her father said, offering an
            explanation but no apology, "and require at least one other
            to witness every legal agreement."
                "Couldn't the witness just lie, too?"

            no further questions were allowed, not least how much guilt he
            was carrying. "Besides, it's more about compromising them.

            creatures with souls do."
                "Sarah," her father warned.
                The truck flew off the road.
                At first, Sarah thought she'd somehow swerved into a ditch
            as the front of the truck dropped, slamming her into the steer-
            ing sheel and sliding her father all the way off his seat into
            the dashboard. He called out, but more in surprise than pain,
            catching himself with his hand. Sarah slammed on the brakes,
            but nothing happened. They kept rocking forward as if they
            would turn a complete somersault-
                Until they were rocked back, both of them helplessly
            thrown into their seats as the rear of the truck now dipped.
                "What the hell?" her father said, alarmed.
                The truck rocked forward again, and Sarah looked out at

                Sarah glanced, too, though she was too afraid to let go
            of the steering wheel to glance for long. The rear claws of the
            dragon had grabbed the truck on either side, like an eagle that
            had just caught a salmon. Sarah looked forward again, at the
            road and trees that were now rushing past beneath them as
            the dragon's great wings beat, carrying them, she hoped, to
            their farm.

                "Is he going to drop us?" Sarah asked.
                She could see that her father didn't know the answer. They

                It was after midnight, but he had a long walk ahead and
            was keen to start. A clear sky and bright moon lit the way. He
            was at the edge of a forest, as expected, near a road the fol-

            late hour, the road would work best to get the miles begun.
                First, though, he knelt to pray. "Protect my path, Mitera

            everything but the fulfilment of my goal."

            as if it might rise to bite him or give way underneath his rough
            shoe. Neither happened, and he turned south. He began to walk.
                It was cold, but again, he was prepared. The coat over a
            woollen top, the thick woolen trousers, gloves and a cap that
            came down over his ears and nearly swallowed his face. It was
            a face others would trust, bright and surprisingly young, still
            a teenager, with blue eyes that neither threatened nor dazzled,
            a smile that was modest and appealing and wholly lacking in
            danger.
                The last part was completely midleading.

            passed a few houses, pulled far back from the road and iso-

                An enormous yellow Oldsmobile turned onto the road well
            ahead of him. Hiding was simple; he disappeared into the
            thicker forest on the non-river side of the road and waited. He
            sat against a tree, facing away from the road, listening to the
            car's engine grow loduer. He was unafraid. They would likely
            not have seen him, and even if they had, what more wa he

            for a small bite of hard track biscuit while he waited for the car
            to be on its way.
                He had the second bite halfway to his mouth before he
            realized the engine had stopped changing in pitch and vol-

            car was no longer moving. He took a slow, slow peek around
            the trunk of the tree, back towards the road.
                The car had stopped exactly where he'd entered the woods.
            It was enormous, all curved corners and obvious weight, like
            a bull ready to charge. It sat there in the frozen morning, on a
            deserted forest road, as if waiting for him. Through the trees he
            couldn't quite tell how many people were inside or what they 
            might be doing. There was a small click and the car seemed to
            settle. He guessed this was as it shifted from drive to park.
                He returned the biscuit to his bad and with a flick of his
            wrists, slid into his palms, the razor-sharp blades hidden in
            his sleeves.
                The woods were quiet at sunrise. Even without snow, the
            frost was thick. No insect yet buzzed, no morning bird sang.
            The only sound was the engine and his breath.
                His eyes widened. His breath. Great steaming clouds of
            it, giving him away as surely as if he'd lit a fire. But then,

            a shower of splinters raining across his body.
                His ear hurt now, and when he touched it, his hand came
            away with an amount of blood that made him focus. He had
