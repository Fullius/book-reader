            On a cold Sunday evenning in early 1957 - the very day, in fact, 
            that Dwight David Eisenhower took the oath of office for the
            second time as President of the United States of America - 
            Sarah Dewhurst waited with her father in the parking lot of 
            the Chevron gas station for the dragon he'd hired to help on 
            the farm.
                "He's late," Sarah said, quietly.
                "It," said her father, spitting on the oiled dirt, hitting the 
            cracks of a frozen puddle. "Don't call it by its name. Don't tell 
            it yours. It. Not he."
                This didn't address the question of the dragon's latness.
            Or maybe it did, in her father's sternness, in the spitting.
                "It's freezing out here," she said.
                "It's winter."
                "Can I wait in the truck?"
                "You're the one who was so eager to come with me."
                "I didn't know he's be late. It would be late."

                Then why are you hiring one? Sarah thought, though knew
            better than to say. She even knew the answer: they couldn't 
            afford to pay men to clear the two south fields. Those fields
            had to be planted, and if they were, then there was a chance - 
            a small one, but a chance - that they wouldn't lose the farm to
            the bank. If a dragon spent a month or so burning the trees,
            carrying out the ash and remnants, then maybe by the end
            of February, Gareth Dewhurst could be turning the charcoal
            over with a pair of cheaply hired horses and the plough that
            was thirty years out of date. Then perhaps by April, the new
            fields would be ready for planting. And perhaps that would be
            enough to hold off the creditors until harvest.
                Such has been the overwhelming, exhausting though of
            both Sarah and her father in the two years since the death
            of her mother, as the farm slid slowly beyond the ability of two
            people to run and further and further into dept. The worry
            was so strong it had shoved their grief to one side so they could
            work every hour her father was awake and every hour Sarah 
            was not at school.
                Sarah heard her father breath out, long, through his nose.
            It was always his preamble to softening.
                "You can drive home," he said, quietyly, back over his 
            shoulder.
                "What about Deputy Kelby?" she asked, her stomach
            tensing as it always did at thought of Deputy Kelby.
                "Do you really think I'd be meeting a hired claw if I didn't
            know Kelby was off-duty tonight? You can drive."
                She was five feet behind him but still hid her smile.
            "Thanks, Dad," she said. At nearly sixteen, she was a few

            months shy of being granted a licence by the great state of
            Washington, but a lot of things got overloooked for the sake
            of farming. Unless it was Deputy Kelby doing the looking.
            Unless you were Sarah Dewhurst being look at, with her
            skin so much darker than her father's, so much lighter than
            her dearly departed mother's. Deputy kelby had thoughts on
            these issues. Deputy kelby would be only too happy to find
            Sarah Dewhurst, daughter of Gareth and Darlene Dewhurst,
            illegally behind the whell of a farm truck, and what might he
            do then?
                Sarah pulled her coat tighter around her, tying the belt.
            It was her mother's coat and she was already outgrowing it,
            but not by enough to find the money for a new one. It strained
            across her shoulders, but at least it kept her warm enough.
            Almost.
                As Sarah put her hands back in her pockets, she heard
            wings.
                They were an hour from midnight - the Chevron was
            closed, only security lights on - and the sky was bitter cold and 
            sloppy with stars, including a spill of the Milky Way across
            the middle. This part of the country was famous for its rain,
            though more accurately for its endless grey days. This night,
            though, Janurary 20, 1957, was clear. The three-quarter moon
            was low in the sky, bright but a supporting player to the specks
            of white.
                Specks of white that now had a shadow cast across them.
                "It won't hypnotize you," her father said. "That's an old 
            wives' tale. It's just an animal. Big and dangerous, but an 
            animal."
                "An animal that can talk," she said.

                Men didn't trust dragons, even though there had been 
            peace between the two for hundreds of years. Her father's
            prejudice wasn't uncommon among people his age, though
            Sarah wondered how much sprung from the way the articu-
            late, mysterious creatures so comprehensively ignored men
            these days, save for the few willing to hire themselves out as
            labour. In Sarah's generation, though, it was hard to find a
            teenager who didn't also want to be one.
                This particular dragon was flying in from the north, which
            Sarah liked to think meant it had come from the great dragon
            Wastes of western Canada, one of the few natural landscapes
            left in the world where dragons still flew wild, still held their
            own socities, still kept their own secrets. She knew this was
            fanciful. Canada was nearly two hundred miles away, the
            Wastes a farther two hundred beyond that. Besides which,
            the Canadian dragons had withdrawn official communica-
            tion with men a decade before Sarah's father was born. Who
            knew what they got up to in the Wastes these past fifty years?
            The individuals who still hired themselves out as labour gave
            no answers, if they even knew. This one was probably only 
            coming from another farm, another place of grubby, poorly 
            paid hire.
                It flew over them.
                He, thought Sarah. He flew over them. The only reason
            she didn't think she was because her father had slipped when
            he first mentioned the hiring. "It's not illegal," he'd dais, which
            Sarah knew, "but there'll be trouble no matter what. We keep
            quiet until he's already working and no one can stop him."
